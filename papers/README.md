section 3.2.3 Branch-free Eytzinger Search (pp 21-22) [q.v. Cannizzo for alt implmentation]


Standard Vs Uniform Binary Search and Their Variants in Learned Static Indexing
Domenico Amato, Giosu´e Lo Bosco, Raffaele Giancarlo
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01554
Algorithm 2 C++ Implementation of Uniform Binary Search with Prefetching. (pg 5)
"The U-BS routine differentiates itself from the Standard one because there is no test for exit within the main loop.
Moreover, depending on the compiler and the architecture, instruction 8 of Algorithm 2 may be translated into a
predicated instruction, which is not a branching instruction."
